Multiple choice game asking sports question involving sports.

Application shows mutliple choice questions on a time limit to answer correctly. 
The technology I used was html,css, and js to show what I have learned in the process. 

Challenges I have faced were the js tab to get the game to function properly. I had to try differet arrangments to make sure the game work and moved the correct way while grading. 
Also get the styling the way I want it to for each slide.

I had assistance with learning with CodingNepal(2020)[Source Code]. https://www.codingnepalweb.com/quiz-app-with-timer-javascript/as well as youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBhpSRS_fk to get a better understanding on how the game works.
